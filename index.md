# Welcome to the Friends of the Earth Open Data Portal

## Environmental Data for Research and Action

Well-targeted data can be a powerful approach to identify where and what action is needed to address the environmental crisis and related social justice issues, and to create the pressure for political and policy change at all levels. 

Friends of the Earth uses environmental data to increase the impact of our campaigns and support activists. 

We are committed to making environmental data accessible to other activists, researchers, advocates, policymakers, and the public. Our open data portal provides free access to data that can help inform environmental action and policy decisions.

## Featured Datasets

### Heat risk MSOAs

We’ve identified the areas in England most exposed to extreme heat using satelitte measured land surface temperature (LST) and modelled air temperature from the 2022 heatwaves. Within these, we’ve also counted the number of care homes, nurseries and hospitals. The data was aggregated to 2021 MSOA boundaries

See our webpages for further info, including the methodology and data sources for the analysis:
