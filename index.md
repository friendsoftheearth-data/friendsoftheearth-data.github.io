# How environmental data can support climate action and social justice

Well-targeted data can be a powerful approach to identify where and what action is needed to address the environmental crisis and related social justice issues, such as warmer homes, cleaner air and affordable public transport. It can also help create the pressure for political and policy change at all levels.

Friends of the Earth uses environmental data to increase the impact of our campaigns and support people taking action across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

We’re committed to making environmental data accessible to other campaigners, researchers, advocates, policy makers and the public. Our open data portal provides free access to data that can help inform environmental action and policy decisions.

### Heat risk MSOAs

We’ve identified the areas in England most exposed to extreme heat using satellite-measured land surface temperature (LST) and modelled air temperature from the 2022 heatwaves. Within these, we’ve also counted the number of care homes, nurseries and hospitals. The data was aggregated to 2021 Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) boundaries

See our research for further info, including the methodology and data sources for the analysis:
