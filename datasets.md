  Pollution
</h2>

Mapping of air pollution and water issues, industrial sites, and environmental justice indicators [when complete].

**Air Pollution in England and Wales by LSOA**
 
Our air pollution data analysis story includes an interactive map: [Which neighbourhoods have the worst air pollution](https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/insight/which-neighbourhoods-have-worst-air-pollution){: target="_blank" rel=noopener}
  
You can download air pollution data for NO2 and PM2.5 by LSOA11 below:
- We've made the data available as a csv file which can be opened in Excel or in GIS software and joined to LSOA boundaries to make your own maps.
      
  [Download LSOA air pollution data (csv)](/datasets/air-pollution/air-pollution-lsoa11-2021-23.csv){: .button }
      
- We've also added a geopackage download, which can be opened directly in GIS software. Note: this uses 'Super Generalised' LSOA boundaries to reduce file size, but may not have the level of detail you want.

  Climate risks and extreme weather
</h2>

Mapping of locations most at risks from extreme weather and flooding.

**Properties at risk of flooding**
We have analysed 'Properties at risk of flooding from rivers and seas' data published by the Environment Agency and aggregated these to different levels of geography. These area available for download here:

**Heat risk MSOAs**
  
  [Coming soon! We are currently analysing Land Surface Temperature data and how to make it available aggregated to LSOA level. Watch this space!]
