  Pollution
</h2>

Mapping of air and water quality, industrial sites, and environmental justice indicators.

- **Air Pollution levels by LSOA**
 
  Our air pollution data analysis story includes an interactive map: [Which neighbourhoods have the worst air pollution](https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/insight/which-neighbourhoods-have-worst-air-pollution){: target="_blank" rel=noopener}
  
  <!-- [View Dataset](#){: .button } -->
  And you can download air pollution data for NO2 and PM2.5 by LSOA11 below:
    - We've made the data available as a csv file which can be opened in Excel or in GIS software and joined to LSOA boundaries to make your own maps.
    - We've also added a geopackage download, which can be opened directly in GIS software. Note: this uses 'Super Generalised' LSOA boundaries to reduce file size, but may not have the level of detail you want.
