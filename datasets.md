### Onshore renewable energy potential

Datasets containing the outputs of our onshore renewable energy modelling that map the priority areas for potential onshore renewable energy installations. And the exclusion layers which show which areas of the country were excluded from this mapping and why.

The data was used to inform this research piece: [Release our wind: Tremendous renewable energy potential in England](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate/release-our-wind-tremendous-renewable-energy-potential-england)

The exclusion maps are experimental and slow to load, so only use on a laptop with a good internet connection.

### Air Pollution in England and Wales by LSOA

Our air pollution data analysis story includes an interactive map: [Which neighbourhoods have the worst air pollution](https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/insight/which-neighbourhoods-have-worst-air-pollution){: target="_blank" rel=noopener}

You can download air pollution data for NO2 and PM2.5 by LSOA11 below. The data is represents a 3 year average for 2021 to 2023.

We've made the data available as a csv file which can be opened in Excel or in GIS software and joined to LSOA boundaries to make your own maps. We've also added a geopackage download, which can be opened directly in GIS software. Note: this uses 'Super Generalised' LSOA boundaries to reduce file size, but may not have the level of detail you want.

We expect to update the data in late 2025, when we will also publish the data using 2021 LSOA boundaries.

Mapping of locations most at risks from extreme weather and flooding.

### Properties at risk of flooding

We have analysed 'Properties at risk of flooding from rivers and seas' data published by the Environment Agency and aggregated these to different levels of geography. These area available for download here:

### Heat risk MSOAs in England

We’ve identified the areas in England most exposed to extreme heat using satelitte measured land surface temperature (LST) and modelled air temperature captured during the 2022 heatwaves. Within these most exposed neighbourhoods, we’ve also counted the number of care homes, nurseries and hospitals. The data was aggregated to 2021 MSOA boundaries.

See our webpages for further info, including the methodology and data sources for the analysis:
 [Which neighbourhoods are most vulnerable to heatwaves](https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/insight/which-neighbourhoods-are-most-vulnerable-heatwaves){: target="_blank" rel=noopener}
